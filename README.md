### JR Data Scientist - Skill Test

The intent of this repository is to provide a business case that applicants will need to resolve as part of the selection process for a Data Scientist role. By no means, we are expecting to profit from this exercise and all resources used are publicly available.

## Problem Statement

You are being provided with the Telco Customer Churn data from the Kaggle IBM Sample Datasets. You are required to create a **Python** model to predict customer churn as well as proposing 5 client retention programs to increase engagement. 


You will have 10 minutes to present your findings and you can use any tool of your preference: Powerpoint, Jupyter Notebooks, Deepnote, GoogleColab, etc.


## What we are expecting to see

- Data findings derived from a clear data exploration process
- Realiable machine learning model - you will be asked to explain the metrics used for the evaluation
- We want to see an organized methodology for resolving Data Science problems: Data Cleaning,Transformation, Training/Testing and Predictions
- Link between your proposed retention programs and findings from the data


## What makes you stand out

You will have extra points if you can show the ability to build reproductable Machine Learning models. 

- Submit your work creating a github repository

- Include a requirements.txt or a enviroment.yml file so that we can reproduce your code

- Include clear documentation on your github branch
